# Favicon Placeholder

You'll need to create these icon files for a complete deployment:

## Required Icons:
- favicon-32x32.png (32x32 pixels)
- favicon-16x16.png (16x16 pixels) 
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 pixels)
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

## Quick Solution:
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Upload an aviation-themed image or use text "CFI"
3. Download the generated favicon package
4. Extract and rename files to match the names above
5. Upload to your GitHub repository

## Alternative:
- Use any 32x32 PNG image and rename it to favicon-32x32.png
- The app will work without icons, but they make it look more professional

The app is fully functional without these icons - they're just for visual polish!
